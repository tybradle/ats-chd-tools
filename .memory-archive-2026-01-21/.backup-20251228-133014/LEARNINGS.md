# Learnings and Patterns

## Patterns
- **Directory Structure**: Clear separation between frontend (`src/`) and backend (`src-tauri/`).
- **Convention-Driven Development**: Use of `AGENTS.md` to define strict rules for AI agents, including tech stack and anti-patterns.
- **Database Migrations**: SQL migrations stored in `src-tauri/migrations/` with numbered prefixes.
